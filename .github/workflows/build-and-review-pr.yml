  #
  # This workflow uses the pull_request trigger which prevents write permissions on the
  # GH_TOKEN and secrets access from public forks.  This should remain as a pull_request
  # trigger to minimize the access public forks have in the repository.  The reduced
  # permissions are adequate but do mean that re-compiles and readme changes will have to be
  # made manually by the PR author.  These auto-updates could be done by this workflow
  # for branches but in order to re-trigger a PR build (which is needed for status checks),
  # we would make the commits with a different user and their PAT.  To minimize exposure
  # and complication we will request those changes be manually made by the PR author.
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
  # paths:
  #   Do not include specific paths here.  We always want this build to run and produce a
  #   status check which are branch protection rules can use.  If this is skipped because of
  #   path filtering, a status check will not be created and we won't be able to merge the PR
  #   without disabling that requirement.  If we have a status check that is always produced,
  #   we can also use that to require all branches be up to date before they are merged.

  build-and-review-pr:
    # This reusable workflow will check to see if an action's source code has changed based on
    # whether the PR includes files that match the files-with-code arg or are in one of the
    # dirs-with-code directories.  If there are source code changes, this reusable workflow
    # will then run the action's build (if one was provided) and update the README.md with the
    # the latest version of the action.  If those two steps result in any changes that need to
    # be committed, the workflow will fail because the PR needs some updates.  Instructions for
    # updating the PR will be available in the build log, the workflow summary and as a PR
    # comment if the PR came from a branch (not a fork).
    # This workflow assumes:
    #  - The main README.md is at the root of the repo
    #  - The README contains a contribution guidelines and usage examples section
